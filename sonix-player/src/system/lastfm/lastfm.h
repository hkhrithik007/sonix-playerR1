// lastfm_note_playback(), and this module decides what counts as a play and

// or four minutes, whichever comes first, for a track of at least 30 seconds.
//
// A worker thread does the network and the files. "Now playing" goes out when
// there is Wi-Fi at the start of a track. Scrobbles go into a queue in .local
// on the card and are sent in batches whenever the Wi-Fi is up. Nothing
// here turns the Wi-Fi on, and the radio is held up only while a request is on
// the wire.
//
// The API account comes from the streaming keys ([lastfm]); without it the
// service is unavailable. Signing in trades the username and password for a
// session key (auth.getMobileSession), which is what is kept, beside
// device_config.ini; the password is not.
