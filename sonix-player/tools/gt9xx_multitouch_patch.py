"""
Removes the one-contact cap from the R3 Pro II's touchscreen driver.

The stock gt9xx_touch.ko reports a single finger even though the Goodix GT967
panel under it reports five. Two separate things cause that, and both have to
be dealt with:

  1. A rate limit inside goodix_ts_work_func's loop over the contacts of a
     frame. This script patches it out of the compiled module.
  2. gtp_max_touch_number=1 on the insmod line, which makes the driver throw
     away any frame carrying more contacts than that. This script rewrites the
     insmod line in gt9xx_touch.sh.

PATCHES.md has the full account of both.

    python3 tools/gt9xx_multitouch_patch.py <module_driver directory>
    python3 tools/gt9xx_multitouch_patch.py --check  <directory>
    python3 tools/gt9xx_multitouch_patch.py --revert <directory>

The directory is the one holding gt9xx_touch.ko and gt9xx_touch.sh inside an
unpacked rootfs. Both files are backed up next to themselves with a .orig
suffix before anything is written, and --revert puts them back.
