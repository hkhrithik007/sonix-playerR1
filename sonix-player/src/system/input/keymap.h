// What the buttons on the side of the device do.
//
// On the R3 Pro II's right side, below the power button, there are three: one
// on its own and a rocker split in two. On the left there is the volume rocker.
// The kernel reports the three media keys as KEY_NEXTSONG, KEY_PLAYPAUSE and
// KEY_PREVIOUSSONG, and reports the skip keys swapped with respect to their
// physical positions -- the stock firmware compensates for that and so does
// this one (see system.c). The R1 has volume up, volume down, play and next,
// all on the right, and no previous key. Nothing here speaks in kernel codes:
// the buttons are named as the person holding the device sees them.
//
// Why it is configurable: a player kept in a pocket is operated by feel, and
// which commands are worth having under a finger differs. Someone listening to
// albums never skips a track and would rather have volume; someone on playlists
// skips constantly. Three buttons, and the choice costs one list.
//
// The in-line headphone remote does not come through here: it sends the same
// codes, but it is another device with another convention (one click, two
// clicks, three clicks), and remapping it together with the side buttons would
// change two things while meaning to change one.
