// Cover art made small enough to send over a slow link.

// Embedded covers are often one to five megabytes: a poster-sized JPEG, or a
// PNG. Over Bluetooth that is seconds per track, all of it on the same radio
// as the headphones' audio. This decodes the picture at a reduced scale (the
// same decoders the interface draws covers with, so a large file never costs
// its full resolution in memory), fits it within `max_side` on its longest
// edge, and encodes the result as a JPEG of `quality`.
//
// Returns a malloc'd JPEG and its length, or NULL when the picture cannot be
// decoded or is already small enough to send as it is -- the caller then sends
// the original.
