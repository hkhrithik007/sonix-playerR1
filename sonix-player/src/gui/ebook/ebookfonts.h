// Bookerly, in the four real styles rather than one face slanted and
// emboldened by the renderer. The firmware ships them in
// usr/resource/sonix/fonts/ebook; a set in `.local/fonts/` on the card is used
// when that folder has none.
//
// So: nothing is loaded until the reader opens, the regular face is loaded
// then, and the other three only when a book actually uses them -- a novel
// with no bold never pays for the bold face. Closing the reader destroys all
// four and the glyph cache with them.
//
// The one rule that cannot be broken: no LVGL object may still point at one of
// these fonts when it is destroyed. ebookfonts_close() is therefore called
// after the reader's objects are deleted, never before.

// Bookerly -- the reader then falls back to the interface font, which is
// a worse book but still a book.

// and bold, from the firmware's fonts folder or the card's .local/fonts)
// instead: Bookerly has no kana or kanji.
