// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Keeping time, the way the stock firmware does it
//
// What the stock firmware does, from reading its scripts and binary:
//
//   * At boot nothing in userspace sets the clock. /etc/init.d/rcS and every
//     S?? script under it were read: no `hwclock -s`, no `date`, no ntpd. The
//     kernel restores CLOCK_REALTIME from the RTC on its own.
//   * Across a suspend ("echo mem > /sys/power/state", at 0x47f660) it does not
//     touch the RTC either, before or after.
//   * On the way out, at 0x48bd04, it runs `hwclock -w --utc` and then
//     poweroff. That is the whole of its persistence, and busybox's `-w` writes
//     the current second verbatim, with no rounding or fudge.
//   * Whenever Wi-Fi associates it shells out to
//     `ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org time.windows.com &` (0x4668b0), gated on
//     wpa_supplicant reporting COMPLETED.
//
// That last one is the only correction the firmware makes, so an RTC that runs
// fast or slow is quietly papered over every time the device sees a network.
//
// This file does the same: read the RTC, write the RTC, and ask the network
// when there is one. No rate correction is applied. A rate error cannot be
// told apart from a user rounding the time to the nearest minute -- clock_set()
// zeroes the seconds, so up to 59 seconds of pure rounding over a span as short
// as ten minutes reads as an enormous drift, and correcting for it is itself
// the drift.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The device nodes busybox's hwclock would use. The stock player shells out to
// `hwclock -w --utc`; writing the ioctl directly does the same job without
// forking, which matters on a device this tight on memory.

// that is consistent even though it is wrong: 21:00 set by hand is held and
// written to the RTC as 21:00 UTC and shown as 21:00.
//
// ntpdate then sets true UTC, and from that moment both conventions live in the
// same device: whoever wrote the RTC last decides what survives a power-off,
// and the clock comes back hours out with the minutes right.
//
// So the device is given a real timezone: the system holds UTC as it should and
// mktime/localtime convert everywhere, with no call site changed. The offset
// comes from the user, in Settings > Date and time > Timezone -- guessing it
// from the gap between a hand-set time and what the network returns needs the
