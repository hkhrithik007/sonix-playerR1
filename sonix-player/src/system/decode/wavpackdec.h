// WavPack: .wv files.
//
// Like Opus, this library is not borrowed from the firmware -- the device does
// not ship it at all -- but statically compiled into the binary by the Makefile.
//
// What those hundred and fifty kilobytes buy:
//
//   * lossless up to 32-bit integer and floating point;
//   * hybrid mode, i.e. a lossy .wv at fixed bitrate plus a .wvc correction
//     file beside it that restores lossless -- when the .wvc is present it is
//     picked up automatically, with no involvement from the caller;
//   * DSD inside WavPack, which the library decimates to 24 bit. A DSD .wv
//     therefore plays, though by that route and not as DoP.
//
// Samples always come out as int32 right-justified at the file's real depth;
// this wrapper shifts them left for the player's 32-bit path, as dr_flac and
// libsndfile already do.
