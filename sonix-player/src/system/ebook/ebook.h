// An EPUB, opened one chapter at a time

// The whole of this subsystem is built around one promise: closing a book gives
// its memory back to the kernel, not to the allocator. Everything a book owns
// lives in one of two arenas (see epub_arena.h) -- the book's, which holds the
// metadata, the spine and the table of contents and stays a few tens of
// kilobytes, and the chapter's, which holds the text of the one chapter being
// read and is thrown away whole at every chapter change. Nothing here ever
// holds the whole book.
//
// There is no LVGL in this half. It hands out blocks of styled text and knows
// nothing about pages, fonts or pixels: how many words fit on a screen is a
// question only the side that owns the fonts can answer, so pagination lives in
// src/gui/ebookreader.c and this side stays measurable, testable and free of
// the interface. tools/test_ebook.c drives it without a display.
//
// What is here: EPUB 2 and 3 reflowable books, paragraphs, headings, emphasis,
// lists, block quotes, images, as much of the stylesheet as changes what is on
// screen (see epub_css.h), the table of contents, and the reading position.
// What is not, on purpose: embedded fonts, JavaScript, fixed layout, DRM.
