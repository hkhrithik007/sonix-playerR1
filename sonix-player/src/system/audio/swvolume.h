// The SW/HDB curve out of the stock ot_devices.json, applied to the samples
// themselves, for the one route that has nowhere else to put the volume: a
// device on the USB-C port with no volume control of its own.
//
// It is NOT part of the volume law on the jacks. There the CS43198's own
// attenuation is the whole of it, and the hardware tables say so on their own:
// each steps 0.5 dB per index from 100 down to 45, 1 dB down to 10, then 2 and
// 5 -- a complete taper, fine at the top and coarse at the bottom -- and MDB
// sits exactly 6.0 dB under HDB at every single index. Adding this curve on
// top gives 0.8 dB per index over the first stretch and 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2.2,
// 3.4 below it, which is neither the stock scale nor an even one.
//
// The curve, and the arithmetic, are HiBy's (routine 0x730c20 in the stock
// binary): 101 attenuations in tenths of a dB, turned into a linear gain by
//
//     gain = 10 ^ (SW[index] / 200)
//
// and then into a Q31 fixed-point coefficient by multiplying by 2^31. The
// division by 200 rather than 20 is the tenths: SW[index] = dB x 10.
//
// The stock engine also carries an offset per hardware table -- LDB -12 dB,
// MDB -6 dB, HDB 0 -- under SW_MIX_GAIN_ENABLE. It is not applied here and
// there is nowhere it could be: it is the software share of the difference
// between two CONVERTER tables, and this curve only ever runs where the
// converter is out of the circuit and the gain switch moves nothing.

// The UI volume index, 0..100. Cheap -- it stores an int; the coefficients were
// worked out once at startup.

// reads across sample boundaries and writes past the last frame. 8-bit is
// unsigned, with silence at 128 rather than 0.
