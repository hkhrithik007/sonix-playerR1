//
// The chapter is in memory as blocks of styled text (see ebook.h); a page is
// however many of those blocks fit on the screen, and the reader keeps only
// the one page. Turning a page lays out the next one and throws the old
// objects away, so a chapter of four hundred paragraphs costs one screenful of
// LVGL objects rather than four hundred.
//
// Where a page ends is found by measuring, not guessed: each block is built as
// a spangroup, asked how tall it would be at the page's width, and added while
// there is room. A block taller than what is left is cut at the last word that
// fits, which is a short binary search over the same measurement -- a handful
// of measurements per page, which is nothing next to drawing it.
//
// What is remembered between pages is a position and not a picture: which
// block, and how far into it. That is twelve bytes, it survives a font-size
// change, and it is what gets written to the config so the book opens where it
// was left.
