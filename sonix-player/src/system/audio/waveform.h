// The shape of a track, for the player's alternative layout to draw instead of
// a progress bar.
//
// One byte per column, 0..255, how loud that slice of the track is on average
// -- not its loudest sample, which on any modern master is full scale in every
// slice and draws a rectangle.
//
// Forty-eight columns across a 480 px panel is six pixels and a gap each. Many
// more than that and a bar is thinner than the rounding on everything else in
// the player, and the whole strip reads as hatching rather than as a shape.
//
// Where it comes from: a worker decodes the file once, at the lowest priority
// the scheduler has, and the answer is kept in a file on the card so it is only
// ever done once per track. Until it is ready the caller draws whatever it
// draws for "not known yet" -- there is no placeholder here, because a flat
// line and a quiet track look the same and only the caller knows which it is
// showing.
//
// The decode is real work and the device has one core, so the worker is
// deliberately timid: SCHED_IDLE, one track at a time, and dropped the moment
// the track changes. It also waits for the audio side to be left alone for a
// few seconds before it reads anything, and stops when a track starts or a PCM
// opens: a whole file read off the card at that moment takes the free memory a
// USB DAC's driver is allocating its buffers from. And it hands the file's
// pages back to the kernel behind itself, so the read fills no cache.
// It does NOT stop when the screen goes dark -- that is the
// one moment nothing else wants the core, and the answer is kept, so the work
// done then is work nobody ever waits for.
