// The streaming services' application credentials, read from a file on the
// device rather than written in here.
//
// Qobuz and Tidal offer no way to talk to their APIs without a pair of
// application keys, and the ones this device has are HiBy's: they live inside
// /usr/bin/hiby_player, Tidal's even assembled byte by byte at run time so it
// never appears as a string. They are HiBy's keys, not this project's, and open
// source that carries them publishes them.
//
// So they sit in a file on the rootfs, which whoever assembles the firmware puts
// alongside the other resource files. It is written as an INI:
//
//     [qobuz]
//     app_id = ...
//     app_secret = ...
//
//     [tidal]
//     client_id = ...
//     client_secret = ...
//
//     [podcast]
//     api_key = ...
//     api_secret = ...
//
//     [lastfm]
//     api_key = ...
//     api_secret = ...
//
// and shipped sealed, as /usr/resource/sonix/components/streaming-keys.bin, by
// tools/seal_streamkeys.py. The key that opens it is not in the source: the
// tool keeps it in streaming-keys.key, outside git, and the Makefile compiles
// it into the player. That keeps the keys out of an unpacked image; it does not
// keep them from whoever takes the binary apart.
//
// A plain streaming-keys.ini next to it is still read when there is no .bin,
// for the simulator and for builds made without a key. Which of the two a file
// is, is decided by its first bytes, not its name.
//
// Without either, or without a section, the matching service disables itself
// and its menu entry says so instead of failing halfway through a login.
//
// The path can be changed with [streaming] keys_file in device_config.ini, to
// keep the keys on the card instead of the read-only rootfs -- the easy path
// the day a service changes its keys.
