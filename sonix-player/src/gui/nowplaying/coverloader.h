// Artwork loading, off the UI thread.
//
// Decoding a cover takes anything from a fraction of a second to several on
// this hardware, so it must never happen on the interface thread: LVGL would
// sit there until the JPEG came back, and scrolling only makes it worse
// because every newly visible row queues another decode.
//
// Requests go to a worker thread, the interface carries on drawing, and the
// finished picture is collected on the next timer tick.
//
// Requests are addressed by slot rather than by handle. A list has a fixed
// number of rows, each row is one slot, and asking a slot for something new
// abandons whatever it was waiting for -- which is exactly what scrolling does.

// Browser rows use slots 0..9; the library index pages (medialist.c) use
// 12..23 for the name lists and 24..35 for the track lists; the search page
// takes 36..59 -- its twelve track hits and twelve album hits; the audiobook
// list takes 60..71 for its twelve rows; one artist's records take 72..83; and the
// album carousel takes 84..89 -- so the pools never trample each other's requests.

// The album carousel's six places take 84..89 -- five that can be seen and one
// that is always just off an edge, because the column scrolls through the
// positions in between and not only from one record to the next. It asks for
// bigger pictures than any list does -- 210 px against the lists' 72 -- but
// never more than six at a time, and only while its page is the one on screen.
