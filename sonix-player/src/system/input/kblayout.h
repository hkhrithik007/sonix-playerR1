// the user has put within reach.
//
// Two lists, the same shape as the control centre's: the ones in use, in order,
// and the rest. The first of the ones in use is the default -- the layout every
// keyboard opens in -- and the others are what the "123" key offers on a long
// press, for one keyboard and until it is next reset. At least one layout is
// always in use.
//
// Both lists live in [keyboard] as lists of names, `layouts` and `layouts_off`,
// so a layout added later joins a saved choice instead of invalidating it. The
// first time round there is nothing saved and the interface language decides:
// its own layout is the one in use and the rest wait in the other list.
//
// The letters are the layouts real keyboards have. English, Italian, Dutch and
// Polish carry the same ones, as they do on a phone; what differs is German
// (QWERTZ and the umlauts), Spanish (the ñ), French (AZERTY), Brazilian
// Portuguese (the ç) and Russian (ЙЦУКЕН). Accented letters come from holding
// a key (kblayout_variant), on every layout.
