// Where the player's output goes.
//
// The device has no console of its own: without ADB, everything printed is
// lost. So stdout and stderr are redirected to a file. That file starts on the
// tmpfs, because at the moment the player begins talking the card is not
// mounted yet, and moves onto the card once there is one -- next to the other
// things the player generates, under .local.
//
// Every line starts with the local time it was printed, to the millisecond,
// and a line with the date goes out first and whenever the day changes. Only
// what goes through stdio is stamped: the crash handler and child processes
// write to the descriptors directly and come out as they are. Daemons go
// through logging_child_stdio() and are stamped a line at a time.
//
// Writing to the card can be turned off (Settings > Developer options): it is
// a constant trickle of writes to the user's music card, worth having only
// while something is being debugged.

// Starts the stamping and redirects output to the tmpfs. Call first thing in
// main(), before anything can print: it replaces stdout and stderr.

// Hands every line printed through stdout or stderr to `tap` as well, without
// its newline and before its stamp, whether or not the log is going anywhere.

// quick and must not print. Only one; set it once, at startup.

// releases the file (output is held in memory meanwhile -- an open descriptor
// on the card would make the unmount fail); resume reopens the file and

// Copies into the log whatever the kernel said about a process being killed.
//
// A process killed with SIGKILL -- which is what the out-of-memory killer
// sends -- runs no handler and leaves nothing behind: the log simply restarts
// mid-sentence. The kernel does say so, in its own ring buffer, and that buffer
// survives the process. Read
// at every start, it turns "it died and nobody knows why" into a line naming
// the killer and the victim.
//
// Also copies the end of what pstore or /proc/last_kmsg kept of the kernel's
// log from before the start, when it shows a crash, and says so in one line
// when the kernel keeps neither.
//
// Says nothing else when the buffer holds nothing of interest, which is the
// normal case. Call once, after the log is on the card.

// moved; call about once a second. Once the log's own writer thread runs it
// syncs by itself and this does nothing.

// of the log's file. Call in a forked child before exec, for any program that
// may outlive the next move of the log (a daemon): a descriptor of its own on
// the card's file keeps the card from being unmounted. Without logging_init()
// it changes nothing.
