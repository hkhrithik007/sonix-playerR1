// ReplayGain: playing a whole card at one loudness.
//
// Whoever tagged the file worked out its loudness once and wrote the
// correction into the tags; the player applies it. Nothing is analysed here --
// an analysis pass over a card of music is minutes of work this device should
// not be doing.
//
// Four states, the same three the stock player offers and an extra option
// (`settings_replaygain_vg_off` / `_track` / `_album` in its binary): off, per
// track, per album, track when shuffled. Track and album are not degrees of 
// strictness: correcting each track of a record separately flattens a movement 
// the producer meant to be quiet, so an album is corrected by one figure and a 
// shuffle by each track's own.
// 'Track when shuffled' uses track gain if shuffle mode is on, album gain 
// otherwise.
