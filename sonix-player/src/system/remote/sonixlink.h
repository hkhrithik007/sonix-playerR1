// SonixLink: the player, answered over the network by a phone.
//
// This protocol belongs to the project, not to the vendor. No bespoke framing,
// no length-prefixed records, no binary type signatures: it is HTTP with JSON
// bodies, and the library is not paged over the wire at all -- the phone
// downloads the index file once and queries it with its own SQLite. Everything
// that goes wrong is then visible in a browser.
//
//     GET  /api/info               what this player is, and how old its index
//     GET  /api/db                 the index file itself
//     GET  /api/covers             the player's own thumbnail cache, as a file
//     GET  /api/state              what is playing, volume, mode, battery
//     GET  /api/queue              the playback queue around the current track
//     GET  /api/favourites         the starred tracks, as they stand now
//     GET  /api/playlists          the playlists' names and sizes, as they stand
//     GET  /api/playlist?name=...  one playlist's tracks, in its order
//     GET  /api/cover?path=...     the artwork beside a track, when there is one
//     GET  /api/art?path=...       the same track's artwork whole, tag or file,
//                                  undecoded: the phone decodes it
//     GET  /api/browse?path=...    one folder of the card, as the file browser
//                                  lists it
//     GET  /api/ping               the app's heartbeat: nothing but "still here"
//     GET  /api/bye                the app has let go: the status bar forgets it
//                                  at once rather than after PEER_ALIVE_MS
//     POST /api/command?do=...     play, pause, next, prev, seek, volume, mode,
//                                  favourite, scan
//
// Found two ways, so neither has to be perfect: a DNS-SD record for
// `_sonixlink._tcp`, which Android resolves by itself, and a plain UDP
// announcement for anything that would rather listen for one.
//
// Threading. One worker thread owns every socket and never blocks on the
// database for long. The player's state reaches it through sonixlink_publish()
// and the phone's commands leave through sonixlink_take_command(), pumped by
// the interface -- the same shape dlna.c uses.
