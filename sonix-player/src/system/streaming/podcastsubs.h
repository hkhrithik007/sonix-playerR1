// Not held by the service, unlike Qobuz and Tidal favourites: Podcast Index has
// no accounts. It is only a catalogue -- searched and read, never logged into
// -- so the list of what is followed belongs to this device and lives on the
// card with everything else.
//
// The list is <card>/.local/podcast.db, an SQLite database like the library and
// audiobook ones; an older podcast-subs.ini, if still present, is imported on
// first start and set aside. The feed id is stored rather than the name, so a
// podcast that changes its title stays the right one; the title and artwork
// held here exist only to avoid querying the catalogue before the list can be
// drawn.
//
// The maximum is a real cap, not a convenience: the list stays in memory for
// the life of the process, and a corrupt or hand-inflated file must not be able
// to eat the RAM playback needs.
