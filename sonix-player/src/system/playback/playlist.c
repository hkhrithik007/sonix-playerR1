// The queue is only ever touched from the LVGL/UI thread (browser selection,
// the progress poll timer, and the player control buttons all run there), so
// like the metadata cache in device_state.c it needs no locking.
//
// Two kinds of queue live here. A *folder* queue is built by walking a
// directory (the browser's way); a *custom* queue is handed in as a list of
// full paths (the library index pages). The distinction matters to
// device_state's resync logic: a folder queue can be rebuilt from the disk at
// any time, a custom one must never be replaced by the folder of whatever
// happens to be playing.
//
// Playback order is a layer of its own: `order` is a permutation of the entries
// and `pos` walks it. In the plain modes it is the identity; a shuffled queue is
// dealt a random permutation up front, which is what lets the queue page show
// the real upcoming order instead of guessing at it. A queue started in shuffle
// begins at the front and fills upwards as it is listened to; switching to
// shuffle with something already playing deals only what is ahead and leaves
// the history where it is.

// A queue is one of two things.
//
// A list of paths: a folder, a playlist file, a streaming album -- entries that
// exist nowhere else and have to be held.
//
// Or a library list, in which case the queue holds the same handle the list
// does: four bytes a track, and the path is read back from the database when
// something actually needs it. Materialising the paths instead would build a
// second full set beside the list's own, which on a large library is megabytes
// for a queue nobody is looking at.
