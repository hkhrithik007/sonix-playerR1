// Bluetooth receiver mode: the player stops being a source and becomes a pair
// of headphones.
//
// A phone or a computer connects, encodes the music its own way and sends it
// over A2DP; this device decodes it and puts it out of its own DAC. Which is
// the point of the whole thing: the amplifier and the output stage here are
// better than the ones in a laptop, and this is the only way to use them for
// something the player is not itself playing.
//
// Two halves, and only one of them lives in this file.
//
// The profile is the other half and belongs to bluetooth.c: while the receiver
// page is open bluealsa runs with `-p a2dp-source -p a2dp-sink` and bluez
// publishes both endpoints in the local SDP record, which is what lets a
// MacBook connect at all -- with only the source endpoint it finds no profile in
// common and Connect() fails. The rest of the time it runs with the source
// alone (bluetooth_set_receiver_profile()).
//
// This file is the audio. bluealsa publishes a capture PCM for the link,
//
//     bluealsa:DEV=<mac>,PROFILE=a2dp   opened for capture
//
// and the loop below reads decoded frames out of it and hands them to
// audio_external_write(), the same door the USB DAC mode and the AirPlay
// receiver come through. One PCM takes one writer, so local playback is stopped
// first: in this mode the player is not playing anything of its own.
