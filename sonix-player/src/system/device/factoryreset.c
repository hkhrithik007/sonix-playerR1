// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// How the original firmware does it, and why that is the only safe way
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The rootfs already contains the two pieces that do all the work:
//
//   /etc/init.d/S39_recovery.recovery   runs at every boot; if the file
//                                       /data/recovery_all exists it reads it,
//                                       runs recovery_all.sh and reboots
//   /usr/bin/recovery_all.sh            deletes /var/lib/bluetooth,
//                                       /var/lib/dbus, /usr/var and then does
//                                       `rm -rf /data/*`
//
// The disassembled original binary does nothing beyond:
//
//     system("echo recovery_all > /data/recovery_all");   // or recovery_data
//     system("reboot");
//
// It leaves a note and reboots. One reason it deletes nothing itself is the
// obvious one: /data is full of files the player has open at that moment,
// starting with its own configuration. The more important reason is that the
// microSD card is mounted under /data, at /data/mnt/sd_0. An `rm -rf /data/*`
// run while the card is mounted would descend into the mount point and erase
// the user's music. The script gets away with it because it runs at S39 while
// the card is mounted by the player at S92: when recovery_all.sh executes,
// /data/mnt/sd_0 is an empty directory.
//
// That is also why this function unmounts the card before rebooting. The
// reboot would unmount it anyway, but the "unmount, write the note, reboot"
// order leaves no window in which a recovery could find anything mounted
// underneath.
//
// The two note variants are `recovery_all` (erase everything) and
// `recovery_data` (keeps usrlocal_media.db, the original firmware's track
// database). This player's database has another name and would not be spared,
// and a factory reset is expected to leave nothing behind: write
// `recovery_all`.
//
// The boot logo is left alone. At this point the original also runs
// `flash_erase /dev/mtd5 0x20000 1`, which clears the theme marker in NAND.
// That is unnecessary here: theme.c rewrites that marker when the theme
// changes, and with the configuration deleted the theme returns to its default
// on first boot by itself. One less write to a flash with a finite erase-cycle
// budget.
