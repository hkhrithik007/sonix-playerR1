// Internet radio, on top of the radio-browser.info directory.
//
// Three separate things live here, and they are separate on purpose:
//
//   * the directory  -- lists of languages, countries and genres, and the
//                       stations under each. Fetched over plain HTTP (see
//                       http.h) on a worker thread; the page polls.
//   * the store      -- an SQLite database on the card, <card>/.local/radio.db,
//                       holding the starred stations and the last few played.
//                       Same shape as the music library's own database, and
//                       next to it.
//   * the transport  -- one thread that pulls the stream into a buffer of a
//                       few seconds and one that decodes out of it and hands
//                       the frames to audio_external_*(), the same door
//                       AirPlay uses. audio.c's own decoder is not involved:
//                       a live stream has no length, no seeking and no end,
//                       and pretending otherwise would mean lying to every
//                       part of the player that asks a track a question.
//
// Everything the directory has is offered. Nothing is filtered out by codec,
// by scheme or by the directory's "broken" flag: a station that cannot be
// played here is listed, marked, and says why when it is tapped.
//
// https:// works: the device's own OpenSSL is opened at run time and the
// certificate chain and hostname are both verified (see tls.h). It needs a CA
// bundle to be present; without one an https station is listed, marked, and
// says what is missing when it is tapped.
//
// MP3 and AAC (ADTS) are the two codecs in the stream path. The codec the
// directory reports is often stale, so a station is tried anyway and the answer
// comes from the bytes.
