//   /usr/data/share/web   the copy thttpd is actually pointed at
//                         (dir= in /etc/thttpd.conf), made once by cgic_enable
//
// cgic_enable copies the first onto the second only when the second is missing,
// then overwrites index.html and js/index.js with the Chinese or English
// variant from pages/, chosen from /usr/data/region. So a player that has ever
// had the feature on keeps whatever tree it got the first time -- which is why
// the stock page can be several firmware versions old.
//
// The copy still has to happen here, because the CGI programs must sit in the
// document root and the shipped directory is where they are. What does not
// happen here is the language dance: the page written into the root is this
// player's own (webpage.h, generated from web/index.html), every start. It has
// no CSS or JS files of its own -- everything is in the one file -- so the
// css/, js/ and pages/ directories that come along with the copy are simply
// never asked for.
//
// The one thing the page does fetch is the typeface, and that is why fonts/
// gets built below.
//
// If the copy will not go -- a full userdata partition being the realistic
// reason -- the shipped tree is served read-only instead, and then the page is
// whatever HiBy shipped, in Chinese. Everything still works.
