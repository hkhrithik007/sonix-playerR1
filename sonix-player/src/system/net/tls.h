// TLS for http.c, on top of the OpenSSL the device already ships.
//
// The rootfs carries /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.1 and libcrypto.so.1.1 (OpenSSL
// 1.1.1f), because the stock player links libcurl. The cross toolchain has no
// headers for them and nothing to link against, so they are opened at run time
// with dlopen() and the two dozen functions needed are looked up by name. That
// is the only way to use a library present on the target and absent from the
// build host, and it has a second virtue: a device whose rootfs lacks them
// still runs the player, it just cannot open an https:// station and says so.
//
// Verification is not optional: the certificate chain is checked against a CA
// bundle and the hostname against the certificate. A TLS connection that
// checks neither is a slower plain socket with a false sense of security, and
// the radio directory supplies URLs from strangers.
//
// Where the CA bundle is looked for, first hit wins:
//
//   1. [network] ca_bundle in device_config.ini -- an absolute path, for when
//      none of the entries below is the right place
//   2. <card>/.local/cacert.pem -- refreshable without reflashing anything,
//      which matters because certificates expire and firmware does not
//   3. /etc/ssl/cert.pem and /etc/ssl/certs/ -- where this OpenSSL looks by
//      default (its OPENSSLDIR is "/etc/ssl"), so a bundle dropped there by a
//      firmware repack is found with no configuration at all
//
// The bundle to use is Mozilla's, which is what a browser trusts. curl
// publishes it, extracted from Firefox's own store, at
// https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem.

// True when libssl and libcrypto were found and every symbol resolved. Cheap
// to call repeatedly; the loading happens once.

// be shown to the user, so it is in the same language as the rest of the
